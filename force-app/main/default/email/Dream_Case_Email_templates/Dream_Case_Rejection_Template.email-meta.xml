    <textOnly>Dear Parent/Guardian of  {!DF_Case__c.Child_Firstname__c}{!DF_Case__c.Child_Last_Name__c},


After review from the chapter, I regret to inform you that  {!DF_Case__c.Child_Firstname__c} {!DF_Case__c.Child_Last_Name__c} dream has not been approved. Our medical team has informed us that due to policies, {!DF_Case__c.Child_Firstname__c} {!DF_Case__c.Child_Last_Name__c}&apos;s illness does not medically qualify for a wish to be granted.


We sincerely appreciate your support and for taking the time to inquire here at Dream Factory Brooklyn.



Best Regards,

Erin DiGiovanni
